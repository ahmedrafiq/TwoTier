QUICK INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

1) Modify the configuration.php with the proper API credentials. 
   Instructions on api_user (user_id) and api_key (user_password) 
   are at:
        http://api.clienttoolbox.com

2) Modify the configuration.php with your own admin credentials. 
   Just replace the filler "admin" and "password" with your own 
   username and password.

3) Copy the contents of this folder to the folder where the site will 
   be live.

4) IMPORTANT: Give the *.txt files (content.txt, preferences.txt) 
   full writeable permissions by the web server process (usually, 
   660 or 775 will do.)


That's it! See? Simple!
